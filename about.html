<p><p>Software engineer. Spanish speaker. Always smiling. Avid animal lover. Philly all the way. I take advice with a grain of salt and a shot of tequila. #TempleMade</p>
<br /><p>I'm much more than that, but it's hard to capture yourself in so few words. I graduated from Temple University with a BA in Spanish. By nature I'm very friendly and compassionate but my time spent living in Philly definitely taught me how to pick out those with ulterior motives behind their actions and statements. Still, the city of Philadelphia-so full of color and character-holds a special place in my heart that will never be erased. I've been working my side hustle Happy Pets by Meg for many years now and have taken care of all kinds of animals. Also as I continue this learning journey, solidifying my software engineering skills, I look for every opportunity I can get to glean advice from others who have been there before me. I may receive helpful advice, I may not, but I always make sure I rely on my own strength and knowledge above all and continue to enjoy myself and the experience.</p></p>
