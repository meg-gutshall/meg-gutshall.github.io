I’ve been diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and PTSD. If you know me well, this may or may not be news to you. If you know me in passing, you’re probably shocked. I habitually get the nickname smiley. I’m always willing to help others, listen to people’s problems, try to give advice. I work really fucking hard at everything I do because the way I see it, if you’re not giving something your best effort, then what’s the point of giving it anything? So when I drop this bomb–this clinical diagnosis that says something is not right with the way my brain works–yet I’m able to keep a positive attitude in my day to day life, I expect people to be shocked.

Although mental illness is becoming a more widely discussed topic, mainly due to a rash of recent high-profile suicides, it is still highly stigmatized and even more misunderstood. Many war veterans suffer from PTSD and it’s great that there are more treatment options available, and that the public is becoming more aware of the challenges they face upon returning home. Many civilians–just ordinary people living among us–also suffer from PTSD, and it may not be caused by something as traumatic as war, but it can still carry lasting effects. Mine manifests in the form of memory loss and nightmares. I can’t do anything to regain the childhood memories that are just gone except hope one day they might come back, but I am taking a medication for the nightmares and it’s really helping. I used to fight through my dreams all night and wake up feeling mentally exhausted in the morning, but now I actually have a good night’s rest.

Anxiety is probably the easiest feeling for people to relate to.

Depression fucking sucks.

December of 2018, I was a wreck. I wasn’t working, I could barely go a day without crying, showers were twice-a-week-ish–I just couldn’t get my shit together. Story of last winter and now where I am

Yes, I’m doing well now. Pretty great actually, considering the incredible amount of stress that I’m still dealing with. Am I worried that I could slip back into a major depression? Terrified of it. But I also have tools that I didn’t have last year. I’ve developed coping mechanisms for when I’m out in public and start to get that itchy, paranoid feeling. I have a psychiatrist who is incredibly knowledgeable and will adjust my medications as necessary to help me function normally in life. I also know for sure which friends I can rely on to talk with about these issues and which I can’t.
