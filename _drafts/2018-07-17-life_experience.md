My childhood was nothing special. As an only child, I grew up in the suburbs of Philadelphia, getting decent grades, playing recreation softball, and overall leading a relatively normal life. After graduating from a high school that was 90% white (the same school district I had attended since kindergarten), I needed a change of scenery. When I was 18, I left for college and began to make up for all the normalcy and ho-hummery of growing up in suburbia. My craving for something different and exciting was a huge factor in why I decided to attend Temple University which was, at the time, the third most diverse school in the nation.

I received three kinds of education at Temple—two of which were free. As a Spanish major, I had the pleasure of working with some of the most dedicated professors at the university.
By living off campus in the ghetto of North Philly… Life experiences and death.

My post-graduate life hasn’t exactly been conventional and I don’t expect that to change now.
