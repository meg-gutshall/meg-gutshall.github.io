During the interview I was told about the great company culture and growth opportunities available and the employees and managers seemed like good people so I was excited to start the job. At first it was really good, the co-workers were nice people and helped me learn a lot about the technology industry. The managers held "lunch and learns" for continued education and started a book club based on different business and recruiting principles. We would have happy hours when we had a good quarter and the managers always stressed J2's culture, how it's like a family and they would consider how all new hires effect the office as a whole. They do strive to make a good company culture but there was always the threat that they could crack down and not be so nice if the numbers weren’t where they wanted them to be at the end of each quarter.

I had direct interaction with everyone in the office and heard all different opinions on what is expected of employees and how the company is run. Time was a big issue. There’s a daily morning meeting at 9 and if you’re late for that twice, you get canned because it’s “disrespectful”. I was late once because my phone died and the alarm didn’t go off but according to the manager, I should have had a back-up alarm set.
