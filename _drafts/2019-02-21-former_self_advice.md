While browsing through Learn.co's Slack one morning, I saw that my education coach, Valerie Jiggetts, had posed a question to the students in one of the channels: **If you could look back on when you first started with Flatiron School, what is one piece advice/encouragement you would give to your earlier self?** and another education coach, Ann Heilman Murphy, building off of her posed: **What is one thing you wish Flatiron had told you from Day 1 or in the early weeks?**

For some reason, this prompt really sparked a response in me. I gave a tidy three-point response on the Slack channel because I'm not about the write a book and annoy everyone on there but it was also an incomplete response which leads me to follow up here with a blog post.

## The Original Slack Channel Response

I would tell her three things:

1. Track your time religiously from day one. When I started using Clockify.me it really helped me to see my daily breakdown of activities and where I could be saving time (aka stop _wasting_ time). Plus, now I track my Flatiron study time by how the curriculum is broken down in the Learn.co dropdown menu so when I meet with my smart, intelligent, lovely education coach and ask how long a section normally takes, I can compare it with my time and get an accurate view of my pace in the curriculum.
2. GO TO STUDY SESSIONS FROM DAY 1!! I missed out on all the Intro to Ruby study sessions with @Nancy Noyes. :sob: I was just plugging away at the curriculum by myself. I know that’s not my most effective learning style, but I guess I was just too scared to step outside my comfort zone. I’m still working on that--_**getting comfortable with being uncomfortable**_--and I feel like I’m getting a LOT better with it.
3. I made this decision, now I have to jump in with both feet—which means making it **priority number 1**. It was hard at first to come to the terms with the amount of sacrifice I would have to go through during the course of this program (socially and financially) but I’ve been able to accept it knowing that it’s only temporary and that once I graduate, the benefits will ten times outweigh the cost.
