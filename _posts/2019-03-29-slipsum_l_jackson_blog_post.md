  <p class="pink ital">Author's Note&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>11/12/20</sup></p>
  <p class="ital">My original blog post was flagged by the DEV Team for violating the Code of Conduct.
  Here's the email they sent me:</p>

  <figure>
    <img class="blog img-fluid" src="/img/post-images/slipsum-l-jackson/dev-warning-email.jpeg" alt="DEV Code of Conduct warning email" />

  <p class="ital">I'm not going to complain about the "free speech police" or anything like that. I could have used a different, less-controversial Lorem Ipsum generator as an example in my post‚Äîthough it's interesting how even Lorem Ipsum generators cause controversies nowadays‚Äîhowever, I highly admire Samuel L. Jackson and think he's a <span class="bold">brilliant</span> actor so I wanted to use this one. The language that violated <a href="https://dev.to/code-of-conduct" target="_blank">the DEV Community's Code of Conduct</a> was all produced by the Lorem Ipsum generator and includes iconic dialog from his many films.</p>
  <p class="ital">I understand the value of creating a safe community and have decided to respect the wishes of the DEV team. That being said, I do think it's a bit ridiculous to flag a post for quoting immensely popular works of cinematography. I've thought for a while about how I can adhere to DEV's CoC while maintaining the integrity of my original post and have decided to take the following steps:</p>

  <ul>
    <li class="ital">I am going to <a href="https://dev.to/meg_gutshall/slipsum-l-jackson-blog-post-3khl" target="_blank">redact my post on DEV</a>, but leave the canonical version unredacted.</li>
    <li class="ital">I am including citation links on each generated quote which take you directly to the quote's IMDb page. This is to assist readers who would like further information on the movies themselves. I'm a fierce advocate for documentation as I believe that it's an easy and universal way to disseminate knowledge to others.</li>
    <li class="ital">I have come across a large list of other Lorem Ipsum generators since first writing this post which I've included in this update. This gives the readers a plethora of options to pick from for their own Lorem Ipsum uses.</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="ital">If you're interested, you can find the redacted post at <a href="https://dev.to/meg_gutshall" target="_blank">my DEV account</a>. Here's an excerpt:</p>
  <blockquote>You listen: we go in there, and that <code>REDACTED</code> Winston or anybody else is in there, you the first mother<code>REDACT</code>er to get <code>REDACTED</code>. You understand?</blockquote>

I created this blog post as part of a demonstration in a recent Code Talk session I recorded about the Flatiron student blogs. Feel free to check out the video below and [view the session notes here](http://bit.ly/code-talk-flatiron-blog).

I know this post is full of bad words. It's actually a bunch of monologues given by one of my favorite actors, Samuel L. Jackson. I found this awesome tool called [Samuel L. Ipsum](https://slipsum.com/) that will generate "motherfucking placeholder text motherfucker". If this isn't for you, search "Lorem Ipsum" generators and I'm sure you'll be able to find something to your liking, perhaps [Cat Ipsum](http://www.catipsum.com/index.php#.XJ7RhutKhTa) so you can "litter your copy with more kitty"?

  <p>Look, just because I don't be givin' no man a foot massage don't make it right for Marsellus to throw Antwone into a glass motherfuckin' house, fuckin' up the way the nigger talks. Motherfucker do that shit to me, he better paralyze my ass, 'cause I'll kill the motherfucker, know what I'm sayin'? <sup><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110912/quotes/qt0447127" target="_blank">[1]</a></sup></p>

  <p>My money's in that office, right? If she start giving me some bullshit about it ain't there, and we got to go someplace else and get it, I'm gonna shoot you in the head then and there. Then I'm gonna shoot that bitch in the kneecaps, find out where my goddamn money is. She gonna tell me too. Hey, look at me when I'm talking to you, motherfucker. You listen: we go in there, and that nigga Winston or anybody else is in there, you the first motherfucker to get shot. You understand? <sup><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119396/quotes/qt0427338" target="_blank">[2]</a></sup></p>

  <p>Now that we know who you are, I know who I am. I'm not a mistake! It all makes sense! In a comic, you know how you can tell who the arch-villain's going to be? He's the exact opposite of the hero. And most times they're friends, like you and me! I should've known way back when... You know why, David? Because of the kids. They called me Mr Glass. <sup><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0217869/quotes/qt0525308" target="_blank">[3]</a></sup></p>

  <p>The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to poison and destroy My brothers. And you will know My name is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon thee. <sup><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110912/quotes/qt0447157" target="_blank">[4]</a></sup></p>

The above is just a sample of some text you can generate with the [Samuel L. Ipsum](https://slipsum.com/) tool.
